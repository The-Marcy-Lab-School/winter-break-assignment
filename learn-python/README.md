# Winter Break Assignment
## Learning Python

### Context
When we return from the break, we will be starting our unit on Data Structures and Algorithms. This unit will be taught in Python, today's most popular programming language for college CS101 courses. Learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Python will allow us to leverage a wealth of resources that are written in the language. Additionally, as we develop proficiency in this language, we will be able to use its numerous open source tools for data analysis in our future projects.

Learning Python will feel very different from learning JavaScript because you are not starting from scratch! Unlike when we started JS in September, now you have a strong base in programming fundamentals. You know how functions work. You know control flow and conditional logic. You understand how to create encapsulated programs using OO. Your task is to (1) translate this knowledge to a new syntax, (2) begin learning the quirks of this new language, and (3) familiarize yourself with the ecosystem that surrounds it. You will have the following resources to do so.

## Resources
* **[Python Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/python-basics-3) on Treehouse** - Our familiar Treehouse tutorials in an unfamiliar language
* **[Object Oriented Python](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-python-2) on Treehouse** - Once you have the basics down, learn how to Object Oriented Python.
* [**Learn Python**](https://classroom.google.com/u/1/w/Mzc0ODUwNjc2ODNa/tc/NDAwODQ1ODI1MDRa) - A Free, text-based resource that allows you to jump around to topics in the order that you need them
* [**Code War - Python Tracks**](https://www.codewars.com/collections/basic-python) - As guidance, when you return from the break, you should be able to comfortably solve problems at the 7kyu level.

## Assignment
* **Podcast**: [Command Line Heroes: Python's Tale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaP4b2nAqm8) - This will introduce you to the large ecosystem that surrounds Python and help you understand why it is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
* [**exercism.io**](https://exercism.io/tracks/python) **- Python Track** - My favorite programming resource ever. Free coding challenges with feedback from volunteer moderators. I challenge you to get as far as you can on the Python track. You know the prize for the winner! ðŸ˜Ž
