# Winter Break Assignment
## December 20, 2019 - January 5, 2020

### Guidance
Congratulations for making it to Winter Break! ☃️
We want you to rest and relax over the break. We also want you to continue to progress toward your goal of becoming a software engineer. The assignments below will ensure that you stay sharp and progress over the break, allowing us to hit the ground running when we return on January 6, 2020.

If you are able to dedicate approximately 10-15 hours per week on the assignments below, you should have plenty of time to get them done and still spend plenty of quality time with friends and family.

### Directions
You have three assignments this Winter Break. You must:
  1. [Learn Python](./learn-python/)
  2. [Apply to at least one job](https://classroom.google.com/u/1/w/Mzc0ODUwNjc2ODNa/tc/NDAwODQ1ODI1MDRa)
  3. [Interview Prep - Tell Me About Yourself](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/Mzc0ODUwNjc2ODNa/a/NDAzMzQxMDA1NTNa/details)
  4. (Suggested) [**Technical Blog Post**](https://github.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/technical-blogging) - As application season begins in January, I want to give you an opportunity to add another blog post to your portfolio. It is another way to showcase your ability to communicate complex topics in an concise, relatable, and understandable way. That said, this assignment is optional. As I want to be respectful of your time off and allow you to prioritize your study of Python.
